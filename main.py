While the difference between the two groups is not dramatic considering the total population, a study by Koen van Gelder (2023) suggests that men are generally more inclined to purchase electronic products online than women. This finding aligns with the observed data, highlighting a slight yet notable difference among male consumers in the electronics market.")
